### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (The lesson on the pop and push method. I learned how to kind of remove a word from an array without actually removing it.)
2. (Another lesson that I felt was helpful in learning was about break statements. From w3 schools it mentioned that with a brea statement code may be continued even after a loop if there is one.)
3. (Through the assignment in cloud 9, I learned more on the else if statements, which was talked about in the previous lesson, but I was able to grasp it more on this particular lesson.)
